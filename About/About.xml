  <description>Nomads' Land adds true nomadism. Pawns with the Nomadic trait will become dissatisfied if they stay settled for too long - time to move on, it's getting worse the longer you wait! Nomads are a close-knit group, and experts in animal handling, but lack the construction skills the average villager has.\n\nThe mod also adds a Sedentary trait, where satisfaction *grows* with the age of the settlement, and pawns are more inclined to be good construction workers and agriculture experts, at the cost of a true love of brawling in the town's tavern.\n\nTo get started, try one of the new scenarios, which force one (or, for extra spiciness, both) of the traits into your tribe, encouraging a true nomadic caravan or sedentary settler life style. \n\n\nVisit the official git repo at https://github.com/hiergiltdiestfu/NomadsLand/ for the GPL3 source code and for filing issues like bugs and feature requests against the mod.\n\nRemoving from savegames containing Nomadic/Sedentary pawns generates errors in the log but simply removes the traits from the pawns. You can continue with the savegame afterwards. Adding or readding does nothing unless you initially select or find/receive new pawns with the Nomadic or Sedentary trait/gene. Might change for when the mod starts adding things like tents.\n\Nomads' Land does not require any DLC or other mod.</description>
