  <description>Nomads' Land adds true nomadism. Pawns with the <i>Nomadic</i> trait will become dissatisfied if they stay settled for too long - time to move on! Nomads are experts in animal handling, but lack the construction skills the average villager has. The trait is inheritable with the Nomadism gene.\n\nThe mod also adds a <i>Sedentary</i> trait (and gene), where satisfaction grows the older the settlement is, and pawns are more inclined to be good Construction workers and agriculture experts, at the cost of a true love of brawling in the town's tavern.\n\nFinally, the mod adds a new scenario which forces the Nomad trait into your tribe, encouraging a true nomadic caravan life style. A scenario for the Sedentary trait is available as well.\n\nAdds some tents for your Nomads to sleep in.\n\nShould be safe to add to savegames. For version 1.4.\nVisit <a href="https://github.com/hiergiltdiestfu/NomadsLand/">the official git repo</a> for the GPL3 source code and for filing issues like bugs and feature requests against the mod.</description>
