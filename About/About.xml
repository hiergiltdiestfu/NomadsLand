  <description>Nomads' Land adds true nomadism. Pawns with the Nomadic trait will become dissatisfied if they stay settled for too long - time to move on, it's getting worse the longer you wait! Nomads are a close-knit group, and experts in animal handling, but lack the construction skills the average villager has. The trait is inheritable with the Nomadism gene.\n\nThe mod also adds a Sedentary trait (and gene), where satisfaction *grows* with the age of the settlement, and pawns are more inclined to be good construction workers and agriculture experts, at the cost of a true love of brawling in the town's tavern.\n\nFinally, the mod adds a new scenario which forces the Nomad trait into your tribe, encouraging a true nomadic caravan life style. A scenario for the Sedentary trait is available as well.\n\nVisit the official git repo at https://github.com/hiergiltdiestfu/NomadsLand/ for the GPL3 source code and for filing issues like bugs and feature requests against the mod.\n\nRemoving from savegames containing Nomadic/Sedentary pawns generates errors in the log but simply removes the traits and genes from the pawns, you can continue with the savegame afterwards. Adding or readding does nothing unless you initially select or find/receive new pawns with the Nomadic or Sedentary trait/gene. Might change for when the mod starts adding things like tents.\n\nNo worries if you don't own the Biotech DLC: The genes will not be available, but the scenarios and traits work just fine.</description>
