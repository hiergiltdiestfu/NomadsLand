    <description>You are nomads, but some of you have changed recently... they are tired, and would rather stay in one place for a while. Time to figure out how that might work without the tribe falling apart over this.\n\nNote: Most of your pawns will have the Nomadic trait, but some will have the Sedentary trait instead - rarely, a pawn will have both. This is a very spicy scenario - how will you handle the ensuing conflicts?</description>

      <summary>Five nomads attempting to find their way around the trading routes of the world with their herd - but some of them want to settle down. Even more difficult than Nomadic Tribe.</summary>
