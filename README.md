# Nomads' Land
A RimWorld mod encouraging nomadic play. 

Use the Issues tab at https://github.com/hiergiltdiestfu/NomadsLand/issues to file bugs and feature requests.

Feel free to fork the repo or reuse any part of the mod under GPL3, unless a specific part conflicts with other licenses (i.e. API use of Rimworld might be subject to other licenses). I've specifically chosen GPL3 to support the seeming standard of documenting the RimWorld mod api via examples.
